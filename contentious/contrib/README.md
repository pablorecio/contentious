# Contenious Contrib Apps

These apps demonstrate different uses of the Contentious framework.  They can either be used directly, or you can just reference them as examples for building your own apps.  You can contribute your own apps too!

Note that most of what the contrib apps do is just the backend work (saving/retrieving the content data to/from the database or wherever it's being stored).  Most of the handling of the front-end stuff (views, static files) is provided for you by Contentious.
